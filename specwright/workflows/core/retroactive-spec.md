# Retroactive Spec Workflow

## Overview

Create detailed specifications for ALREADY IMPLEMENTED features by analyzing existing code.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Interactive dialog for clarifying implementation details
- Codebase analysis to understand current state
- No story generation (feature is already built)
- Output: spec.md + spec-lite.md + code-references.md

**When to use:**
- Documenting legacy features without specs
- Reverse-engineering existing functionality
- Creating specs for features implemented before Specwright adoption
- Understanding undocumented code

**Output Structure:**
```
specwright/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-retro-[feature-name]/
├── spec.md                # Full specification
├── spec-lite.md           # Quick reference
└── code-references.md     # Referenced code files
```

**Difference from /retroactive-doc:**
- This creates spec files (spec.md, spec-lite.md) ready for change management
- /retroactive-doc creates user-facing documentation in .specwright/docs/

<process_flow>

<step number="1" name="feature_identification">

### Step 1: Feature Identification

User describes the feature that needs to be documented.

<mandatory_actions>
  1. CHECK if specs already exist:
     - LIST: specwright/specs/ directory
     - LOOK FOR: Any spec with [feature-name] in the folder name
     - GREP: For feature keywords in existing spec.md files

  2. IF existing spec found:
     INFORM: "A specification already exists for this feature: [path]"
     PRESENT: Options via AskUserQuestion:
       ```
       Question: "A spec already exists for this feature. What would you like to do?"

       Options:
       1. Use existing spec
          → Exit and reference existing spec

       2. Update existing spec with changes
          → Manually update the existing spec files

       3. Continue with retroactive-spec anyway
          → Create parallel documentation (e.g., for different perspective)
       ```
     IF choice = "Use existing": EXIT with reference to existing spec
     IF choice = "Update existing": INFORM: "Please update the existing specification files directly"

  3. ASK user to describe the feature:
     - What is the feature called?
     - What does it do from a user perspective?
     - Who uses it?

  4. GATHER optional code file hints:
     - Ask: "Do you know which code files are relevant? (optional)"
     - Collect file paths if provided

  5. STORE: Feature description for analysis phase
</mandatory_actions>

</step>

<step number="2" name="codebase_analysis">

### Step 2: Codebase Analysis

Analyze existing code to understand the implementation.

<substep number="2.1" name="discover_code">

### Step 2.1: Code Discovery

<mandatory_actions>
  IF user provided file paths:
    1. VERIFY all files exist
    2. GROUP files by type (components, services, APIs, etc.)
    3. PROCEED to Step 2.2

  IF no files provided OR partial information:
    1. SEARCH for relevant code files (Main Agent):
       - Use Glob to find relevant directories based on feature name
       - Use Grep to find feature-related code (keywords, class names, function names)
       - Check common locations:
         - UI components (src/components/, src/pages/, app/)
         - API endpoints (src/api/, src/controllers/, src/routes/)
         - Services (src/services/)
         - Database models (src/models/, src/entities/)
         - Configuration files
       - Adapt search paths to project structure (not all projects follow src/ convention)

    2. COMPILE file list:
       - List of all relevant files with paths
       - Brief description of what each file does
       - Entry points (where feature starts/interacts)
</mandatory_actions>

</substep>

<substep number="2.2" name="analyze_implementation">

### Step 2.2: Implementation Analysis

<mandatory_actions>
  1. READ all discovered code files

  2. ANALYZE the implementation (Main Agent):
     Create a comprehensive analysis covering:

     1. **Entry Points**: Where does the feature start? (UI components, API endpoints)
     2. **Data Models**: What data structures are involved?
     3. **Business Logic**: What are the core operations?
     4. **APIs/Interfaces**: How does it communicate? (endpoints, methods)
     5. **UI Components**: What does the user see/interact with?
     6. **Dependencies**: What does it rely on? (libraries, services)
     7. **Configuration**: How is it configured?
     8. **Data Flow**: How does information move through the feature?

  3. IDENTIFY unclear areas that need user clarification

  4. STORE: Analysis for validation step
</mandatory_actions>

</substep>

<substep number="2.3" name="interactive_clarification">

### Step 2.3: Interactive Clarification (Iterative)

<mandatory_actions>
  1. REVIEW analysis for unclear areas

  2. IDENTIFY questions based on code analysis:
     - Unclear business logic
     - Missing context for decisions
     - Unclear user flows
     - Ambiguous naming or purposes
     - Unclear error scenarios

  3. IF questions exist:
     ASK user via AskUserQuestion (one at a time):
     ```
     Question: "I found [OBSERVATION] in the code, but I'm not sure about [UNCLEAR_ASPECT].

     Context: [CODE_SNIPPET_OR_REFERENCE]

     Can you clarify: [SPECIFIC_QUESTION]?"

     Options:
     - [Specific answer option]
     - [Specific answer option]
     - [Specific answer option]
     - Custom (user types explanation)
     ```

  4. DOCUMENT: User clarifications

  5. REPEAT: Until all questions are answered

  6. CONFIRM: Feature understanding with user
</mandatory_actions>

</substep>

</step>

<step number="3" name="feature_validation">

### Step 3: Feature Understanding Validation

Present the understood feature to the user for confirmation.

<mandatory_actions>
  1. SYNTHESIZE understanding from analysis + clarifications:

  2. PRESENT to user:
     ```
